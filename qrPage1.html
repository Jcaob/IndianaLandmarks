            <p class="qr-des">During the mid-1940s, a slim young man walked through the door of the 440 Club, one of the dozens of nightclubs supporting an emerging jazz and blues scene on Indiana Avenue. John Leslie Montgomery, who went by the name “Wes,” was responding to an ad with a simple request: “Talent Wanted.” Years later, jazz lovers around the world would come to recognize Montgomery as one of the greatest jazz guitarists who ever lived.</p>

            <p class="qr-des">By the late 1960s, he had been honored with two Grammy Awards and several Grammy Award nominations. Throughout his career, he also was recognized with numerous other recognitions, including Record World’s Jazzman of the Year by Record World and Billboard Magazine’s Most Promising Jazz Instrumentalist.</p>

            <p class="qr-des">But the road to fame was paved with hard work. As a teen, Montgomery, who was born in Indianapolis on March 6, 1923, spent hours practicing on the four-string tenor guitar that his older brother, Monk, had bought him from a pawn shop. Years later, Wes recalled, he had to learn to play all over again when he was able to purchase his first six-string guitar. Many nights, out of concern that he would wake his family and neighbors with his practices, Montgomery would play with his thumb instead of a pick. That style of playing, along with the use of octaves in his jazz improvisations. eventually became his trademark.</p>

            <p class="qr-des">Montgomery, who often played with his brothers Monk and Buddy, continued to make a name for himself on Indiana Avenue during the ‘50s and ‘60s. In addition to the 440 Club, he was a regular performer at the Turf Club, the Missile Room, and the Club Harlem. It was during those performances that he started getting the attention of jazz critics and, eventually, a producer. He signed a recording contract with Riverside Records, performed with other jazz greats like John Coltrane, Miles Davis, and Jimmy Smith, and took his innovative playing style on tour for larger audiences.</p>

            <p class="qr-des">Although Montgomery tragically died of a heart attack at the age of 45, leaving behind his wife and seven children, his legacy on Indiana Avenue and his imprint on jazz fusion and smooth jazz is everlasting. Stevie Wonder was among the numerous musicians who wrote tributes to honor the jazz great. And many agree with jazz guitarist Bobby Broom who said that Montgomery introduced a new approach to playing the guitar, one that today is still unmatched.</p>
