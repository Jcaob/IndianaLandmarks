            <p class="qr-des">On the evening of July 8, 1913, the esteemed educator Booker T. Washington spoke at the dedication ceremony of the new Senate YMCA at the corner of Senate Avenue and Michigan Street in downtown Indianapolis. Other dignitaries at this formal gathering for this $100,000 facility included business entrepreneur Madam C.J. Walker and former U.S. Vice President Charles V. Fairbanks. They attentively listened as Washington spoke of the hope this magnificent structure would bring to every discouraged young black man in the community. </p>

            <p class="qr-des">The organization had its roots in the vision of two local doctors who created a similar organization, the Young Men’s Prayer Band, after several black men had been rejected for YMCA membership. The prayer band became the Indianapolis Colored YMCA in 1902. Over the next decade, the new organization outgrew its original building. The growth caught the attention of Chicago philanthropist Julius Rosenwald, who pledged a $25,000 grant to fund a new building if local supporters could raise another $75,000.</p>

            <p class="qr-des">In a mere 10 days, the fundraising campaign succeeded. The Central YMCA Association raised nearly $60,000 and a group of black organizers raised more than $20,000, including a $1,000 donation from Madam C.J. Walker. According to an international YMCA official, “Indianapolis had accomplished something that no other city had even attempted — the raising of a large fund directly for a colored YMCA.” </p>

            <p class="qr-des">In the years that followed, the Senate YMCA increasingly became a source of inspiration for tens of thousands of black people who continued to face discrimination and segregation in so many aspects of their daily lives. Under the leadership of Faburn E. DeFrantz, who served as executive secretary from 1916 to 1951, the Senate Avenue Y became the nation’s largest black YMCA and a beacon of hope in the struggle for equality. </p>

            <p class="qr-des">One of the organization’s most successful and noteworthy programs was its Sunday afternoon “Monster Meetings,” an ongoing lecture series that over the years brought to the podium national leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Thurgood Marshall, Paul Robeson, W. E. B. Du Bois, George Washington Carver, Langston Hughes, and Eleanor Roosevelt, as well as distinguished local figures. These speakers addressed the most critical social and political issues of the day. Although the Senate Avenue Y was demolished in 1959, the Monster Meeting tradition continues in a contemporary lecture series presented by the YMCA of Greater Indianapolis.</p>
