            <p class="qr-des">In late 1927, when the headlines of black newspapers frequently highlighted the latest struggles against discrimination, voter suppression, and segregation, the Indianapolis Recorder was thrilled to announce something entirely different — the opening of a distinctive four-story building at 617 Indiana Avenue.</p>
            <p class="qr-year">1927</p>

            <p class="qr-des">The front page of the Recorder’s December 31st issue used words like luxury, loveliness, and exquisite taste to describe the Madam C.J. Walker Building. The building promised to continue the black entrepreneur’s legacy in the heart of Indiana Avenue, the city’s bustling black business district. “The Great New Playhouse,” as the Recorder described it, featured unique details like doorways embellished with colorful African masks and African Art Deco accents. The building featured a drugstore, a beauty school, a coffee shop, professional offices, a 1,500-seat theater, and a grand ballroom. </p>

            <p class="qr-des">Walker, a philanthropist who supported black communities and advocated for social justice and women’s suffrage, purchased the land that would later become the home of the Walker Building. Under the guidance of her daughter, A'Lelia Walker, Walker’s vision was realized eight years after her death.</p>

            <p class="qr-des">After a major renovation, largely funded by Lilly Endowment and the U. S. Commerce Department, the building reopened in 1984. The Walker Theatre reopened four years later, in 1988. Today, the Walker Building continues to welcome visitors to performances and events in its luxurious theater and ballroom.</p>
